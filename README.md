# Yaml_to_push_to_ACR

This pipeline will build the Docker image using the specified Dockerfile and push it to the Azure Container Registry with a tag that matches the build ID of the pipeline.

Before running this pipeline, you'll need to set up an Azure Container Registry and update the imageRepository and containerRegistry variables in the pipeline YAML file to match your registry name and image name respectively.

Additionally, you'll need to make sure that your Azure DevOps pipeline has the necessary permissions to access the Azure Container Registry. You can set this up by creating a service connection in Azure DevOps that allows the pipeline to authenticate with the container registry.

Once you've made the necessary changes to the pipeline YAML file and set up the necessary permissions, you can run the pipeline and the Docker image will be built and pushed to your Azure Container Registry.
